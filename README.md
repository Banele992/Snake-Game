# 🐍🎮 Java Snake Game

**Java Snake Game** is a classic arcade-style snake game implemented using **Java Swing**. This project showcases core concepts of 2D game development, event handling, collision detection, and state management using object-oriented programming in Java.

Built with simplicity and retro nostalgia in mind, the game features:

* Real-time keyboard input for directional movement
* Food generation and score tracking
* Snake growth mechanics
* Game over and restart menu functionality

## 📌 Key Features

* 🎮 **Arrow-key based movement**
* 🍎 **Random food spawning**
* 🐍 **Snake grows on eating food**
* 💥 **Game over when hitting walls or self**
* 🔁 **Restart and exit options in game over menu**
* 🎨 **Custom graphics with bordered play area**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Java 17+
* **GUI Framework:** Swing
* **Development Tool:** IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any Java-supporting IDE
* **Build Tool:** None required (pure Java application)

---

## 💻 System Requirements

Before running the application, make sure your system has:

* ✅ Java JDK 17 or newer
* ✅ Java-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse)
* ✅ Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## 📦 Project Structure

```bash
SnakeGame/
├── App.java              # Main entry point - launches menu
├── Menu.java             # Start screen with buttons
├── SnakeApp.java         # Core gameplay panel (logic + drawing)
├── GameOverMenu.java     # Menu shown after game ends
├── assets/               # (Optional) image or audio assets
└── README.md             # This file
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-snake-game.git
cd java-snake-game
```

### 2. Open in Your IDE

Open the project folder in your favorite Java IDE.

### 3. Compile and Run

* Run `App.java` as a Java Application.

OR

### 4. Run from Terminal

```bash
javac *.java
java App
```

## 🎯 Gameplay Instructions

* Use **Arrow Keys** to move the snake.
* Eat the red food blocks to grow.
* Avoid hitting the **borders** or your **own body**.
* The game ends on collision, showing your final score.
* Click **Restart** to try again or **Exit** to quit.

---

## ⚙️ Customization Tips

You can easily customize the game:

* 🎨 Change colors in `paintComponent` methods
* ⏱️ Adjust speed via `new Timer(100, this)` (lower = faster)
* 🍎 Prevent food spawning on the snake's body (optional enhancement)
* 🧱 Add walls or power-ups

---

## 📚 Concepts Demonstrated

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Java Swing GUI
* Key event handling
* Timers and game loops
* Collision detection
* State management (game vs. menu vs. game over)

---

## 🧪 Known Limitations

* Food can spawn near borders unless manually offset
* No mobile/touch support
* No high score tracking (yet)
